## How It's Made

**Tech used** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Firebase, Firestore, Vite

This project utilizes a Vite built React frontend and a Firebase backend that handles both authentication via Google and realtime database storage via Firestore.

## Optimizations

Initially this React project was built with the default create-react-app but quickly moved to Vite for a reduced build time and smaller bundle size. The project was also optimized for mobile devices and tablets. The chat application was also optimized for speed by using a realtime database and only loading the last 20 messages on initial load.

## Lessons Learned

This project was a great introduction to Firebase and Firestore. I learned how to use Firebase to handle authentication and how to use Firestore to store and retrieve data in realtime. I also learned how to use Vite to build a React application and how to optimize a React application for mobile devices and tablets.
